NAME

    Algorithm::GLPK::GLPsol - lame interface to the great Gnu Linear
    Programming Kit solver, GLPK and glpsol

VERSION

    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    GNU provides a Linear Programming solver at
    https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/. GLPK stands for Gnu Linear
    Programming Kit and it is a prerequisite to the current module. Make
    sure you have the developer version of GLPK via your package manager or
    from source <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/>. The author of GLPK is
    Andrew Makhorin, mao@gnu.org.

    In addition to being great and of great help it is also free and open
    source in the great GNU tradition. And in the UNIX tradition too
    although GNU is not UNIX :)

    The current module provides an XS interface to GLPK's glpsol executable
    but without calling the executable itself, via system() or exec().
    Instead we lamely built an XS interface to glpsol which it takes in
    command-line args exactly how glpsol would and runs it. That means that
    the input program and the output solution are files and not strings
    which are passed in and returned back from glpsol. That would be ideal
    of course but GLPK's API <https://most.ccib.rutgers.edu/glpk.pdf> is
    too complex for me to decypher and understand how to tell it to create
    a program using GLPK's API.

    See RELATED for information about a proper porting of GLPK's API to
    Perl/PDL with PDL::Opt::GLPK.

    Example usage:

        use Algorithm::GLPK::GLPsol;
    
        my $ret = Algorithm::GLPK::GLPsol::glpsol(
          [
            '-m', 'input-program.mod',
            '-o', 'output.sol'
          ],
          # optional verbosity level as integer >= 0 (0 means mute)
          $VERBOSITY
        );
        die unless $ret == 0;
        # you can read the solution from output  file ... lame I know!
    
        ...

EXPORT

    This module can export these:

      * glpsol : e.g. use Algorithm::GLPK::GLPsol qw/glpsol/;

SUBROUTINES

 glpsol

    glpsol(['-m', 'inprogram.mod', '-o' 'out.sol'], $VERBOSITY) or die;

    It calls glpsol with the specified command-line arguments to GLPK's
    glpsol executable as an ARRAY_REF as the first parameter and,
    optionally, an integer denoting the verbosity level as the second
    parameter.

    glpsol() is an XS sub which calls GLPK's glpsol command. It is not as
    lame as calling it via system() or exec() but it does not use GLPK's
    API <https://most.ccib.rutgers.edu/glpk.pdf> which would have been the
    most preferable way to do this. The reason being that I do not know how
    an LP program in GNU's MathProg can be translated to API calls. It is
    too complex for me at the moment.

    So, logically, this way should be faster than calling the glpsol
    executable via a system() call but slower (?) than doing it with API
    calls. Having said that, I have not benchmarked this claim.

    The most time consuming task is to write your program to a file before
    passing it to glpsol() and then reading the output solution from file.

  glpsol COMMAND ARGS

    All the command line options to glpsol() are documented here
    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Using_GLPSOL

  RETURN

    It returns 1 on failure, 0 on success.

    I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of

RELATED

    There is a proper port of GLPK to Perl/PDL provided by Jörg Sommrey
    <https://metacpan.org/author/SOMMREY> published as PDL::Opt::GLPK.

    As far as I can understand, PDL::Opt::GLPK does not accept MathProg
    <https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~bohm/texts/mathprog_intro.html> programs but
    it requires that the problem be specified with PDL matrices.
